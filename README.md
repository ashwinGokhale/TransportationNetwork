# TransportationNetwork

### Visualizing Graph Traversals using Processing pde in Java

This is a side project revisiting an old project from a previous course I took the summer of my junior year of high school. I use Processing to create a transportation network and where passengers want to get to one location to the other using a certain vehicle. I use Djikstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path based on the distance between pixels from edge to edge.



### TODO
Animate the graph traversals of each passenger
Create custom paths so that airports can be added.
Add time intervals in the form of frame rate
Add cost($) for paths so passengers can choose whether to travel based on time or cost
Add different colors for different vehicle types
